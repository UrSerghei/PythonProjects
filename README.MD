## Introduction

This repository contains a variety of Python projects that showcase different programming techniques, libraries, and applications. These projects range from simple scripts to more complex applications, suitable for developers at all levels.

## Projects

### Project 1: Birthday Card

**Description**: In the CSV file, we have a list of our friends that contains birthday dates. This program checks for a date and sends greeting cards so you don't have to worry about forgetting to greet your friend.

### Project 2: Text To Speech

**Description**: This project demonstrates how to convert text into speech using the Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API in Python. The script uses a service account for authentication and generates an audio file (MP3) from the given text input.


## Installation

To run any of these projects, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Python.git
    cd Python
   
2. Navigate to the project directory you want to run:

   ```sh
    cd project_directory
   
3. (Optional) Create a virtual environment:

   ```sh
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   

5. Install the required dependencies:

   ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

To run a specific project, navigate to its directory and execute the main Python file. For example, to run the simple BirthdayCard project:
   ```sh
    cd BirthdayCardProject
    python BirthdayCard.py
```

Refer to the README file within each project directory for more detailed instructions.
