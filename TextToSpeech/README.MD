# Google Cloud Text-to-Speech Example

This repository contains a simple example of using the Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API to convert text to speech.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or later
- Google Cloud SDK installed and initialized
- A Google Cloud project with the Text-to-Speech API enabled
- A service account key file (`key.json`) for authentication

## Installation

1. Install the Google Cloud Text-to-Speech library:

```sh
pip install google-cloud-texttospeech
```

2. Make sure you have the service account key file (key.json) in the same directory as your script.

## Note

Make sure to replace `key.json` with the path to your actual service account key file. Additionally, handle the credentials securely and avoid exposing sensitive information.

If you encounter any issues or have questions, refer to the Google Cloud Text-to-Speech documentation or seek help from the community.
